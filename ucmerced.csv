I have made a post on the merced thread before and everyone was super nice and helpful so I am hoping to get some help again ! I am still in high school and will be an incoming senior, and would like to create a website where other high school students can voice their opinion anonymously (or if they want they can put their name). This can be like a safe space where it can help other students facing a problem or going through anything and for them not to feel judged when voicing their own opinions. Ive seen as a high schooler people tend to lean towards the majority because they are scared just just shy but this would be a place for them to share their thoughts and troubles and for other people who want to be genuinely nice, to show that there is good in the world.

GPA: 3.9 (unweighted) 4.5 (weighted), SAT: 1470

I'm a pretty decent student and if I really put my mind into it, I can do really well in my academics. I want to go to grad school in the future and currently **majoring in compsci** and maybe either double majoring or minoring in economics. 

I was originally wait-listed for Davis and in the mean time I committed to Merced. Over the past month, I've gotten more and more excited to go to merced because it has more opportunities, funding, and it's a smaller school so more chances to get to know professors. All of what it offers (despite not being so well known) is really attracting for me.

However, I just got off the wait list for Davis and now I'm really **confused** on what to do and I have only a few days left to decide. Davis is more well known but also competitive. Merced is lesser known but has more opportunities. Grad school has always been a dream of mine so I want to go to an undergraduate school that prepares me well for that.

So, any advice? UC Davis or UC Merced?

(Extra info: My coach told me to go to Merced because there's less people, more opportunities, and more money. My mom wants me to go to Davis because it's more well known and has a better reputation).",1.0,0.0,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,1184.0,public,self,UC Davis or Merced for Compsci??!!,0.0,[],1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/gmxul6/uc_davis_or_merced_for_compsci/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hello ,

Decision day is tomorrow and I need help choosing between 2 colleges. CSUN and UC Merced. Both as bio majors. Cost is not a factor for my choice. Some factors are overall campus environment, class difficulty (specifically as a bio major), and transferability to another UC. I know its harder to transfer from CSU or even from UC to a UC but my family is pressuring me to go to a 4 year then transfer. Any information about UCM or anyone who is taking bio currently at UCM would be greatly appreciated. thanks !",1.0,0.0,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,1160.0,public,self,Help me decide!

While I know there's multiple posts on this already, I wanted more clarification as to 3 things; social events, kitchen use, and fitness center. It doesn't seem like UC Merced is much of a party school, and I'm honestly fine with it. But, is being in UC Merced a viable place to hang out with a group of friends and is traveling to the town nearby fun or at least a decent place to go to on weekends. 

Another thing is the kitchen use. I know UCM has trash food and honestly I was gonna cook for myself anyways 99% of the time. So how's the kitchen situation looking like on average? I presume I have to provide the food to cook myself but is the equipment good for using daily and is it available almost daily. If not, is there a microwave available and are we able to bring our own if needed.

I also want to use the weightlifting gym as much as possible, how is the equipment there? Is it mostly machines or are there freeweight sections for deadlift, squat, and bench? Also is it empty most of the time or is it pretty stacked throughout the day.

What are my housing options and what are the pros and cons of choosing the different types?

My intended major is Psychology, but I might switch to something else, is that a good idea(very open to ideas), or should I stick with it?

The security payment is due at the same time as the decision deadline right? (May 1st)

Is the meal plan useful or should I stick with making meals for myself a lot? 

Is it easy to make friends? I don't know anyone going so I'm hoping I can just make friends easily. 

I tried to find a way to contact them, and the Student First Center was the only thing I could find. I asked a question and it took a bit to respond but the response looked very automated and didn't feel like a real person. Is there a place I can contact someone real... that would be able to help me with making sure I've turned everything in and not missing anything? 

Would it be smart to bring my bike with me? I also have a car so is there a rule for not parking on campus for freshman or something along those lines? Skateboard maybe? 

This one may sound really dumb, but do I choose my own classes? No one in my family went to college so they aren't helpful, but do I make my own classes or is it like high school where they choose my classes for me based on my major? 

Do I have to deny all my other colleges or can I just accept Merced and not respond to the others?

When do I apply for housing? I see that the deadline for continuing students is soon, but when do I apply for my own housing (incoming freshman)?

I'll try to think of more questions but these are the general ones I've thought of for now. Hopefully I can get some responses. Thank you.

GPA (unweighted) : 3.90, GPA weighted: 4.50, SAT: 1470 

So I'm a decent-ish student and I applied to all the UC's and got into all of them except for Berkeley and UCLA, and got waitlisted for Davis which makes sense because for the past 4 years I've only focused on medical so I had no computer science experience whatsoever when I applied. I wanna stay in NorthCal (I'm from Bay Area). Right now, **I wanna decide between Merced and Santa Cruz just in case I don't get into Davis.** 

I wanna go to graduate school for sure so I wanna spend most of the next 4 years getting as many experiences and internships as possible so I wanna go to a university with opportunities. I'm also an outgoing student so I'm willing to go out of my way to get them, but it would be nice to go to a uni with connections. I also think that going to a smaller and less competitive university such as Santa Cruz and Merced would make it easier for me to stand out amongst my peers.  

I've also thought about double majoring in either biology or business. I'm not too sure about any of that right now, but that's also in the back of my mind when making this decision. 

And that's pretty much it about me. I know this post was all over the place (essentially just a brain vomit) but taking all of this into account, **which UC would you guys prefer: UCSC or UCM?** 

Also, is Merced's reputation really that bad?

Could you help us understand how emotions buffer people against stress experienced by immigrants?

To participate in this study, you need to be

1. 1st (International students) or second-generation immigrant and
2. In college or graduate school

You will only take some short online surveys (25 minutes long). We don't collect any information on immigration status or physical address. 1 in 5 participants will win a $25 Amazon gift card. This study satisfies the criteria for Exempt Research.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**This research can help identify more protective factors for immigrants with fewer resources.** **Further , this study hopes to contribute to reducing health disparities in immigrant families.** If you are willing to help, please reach me by direct message.

My friend group and I are currently in a debate on if Mac n Cheese is considered ethnic food. On top of that is Soul Food and Southern Food considered ethnic?

Greetings!

I am a doctoral student in counseling psychology at the University of Miami. As part of my dissertation research, I am conducting a survey of impostor feelings and experiences among Hispanic or Latin American students. I would greatly appreciate if you could participate and/or forward this study to potential participants. Participation in the study is expected to take approximately 15 minutes.

Participants must self-identify as Hispanic, Latino/a/x, or having an ethnic background from Spanish or Portuguese speaking areas of Latin America. Participants must also be currently enrolled in a college or university program, read English proficiently, have spent their formative years in the US, and be over the age of 18.

To qualify for participation in the study, please click here: https://umiami.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_ewIGPAU0tzdAhtb

Participation is confidential and voluntary, meaning participants may withdraw from the study at any time. If you have any questions, you can contact me at n.rios1@umiami.edu.

I’m a UCM senior about to graduate this Fall 2019 and will have a room available for rent starting Dec. 14.

I’m currently living in a home with 2 other female seniors. The home is a 2 story home located in the Bellevue Ranch area, 3 rooms, new washer + dryer, nice kitchen, large backyard, 2 car garage, and rent is $400 per month (plus utilities ~$35-40).

Cats are okay, 420 friendly, quiet household, friendly roommates, 15 min walk to 2 bus stops. 

The room can come partially furnished with a desk + shelves, but you would need a bed. The room also has a balcony attached to the room. You would share a bathroom with 1 other roommate.

According to various online stats, the majority ethnicity at each campus differs. The list below cites the majority ethnicity at each campus:

[**UC Riverside: Hispanic**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html)  
[**UC Merced: Hispanic**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts)  
[**UC Santa Cruz: White**](http://diversity.ucsc.edu/diversity/images/student_demo_2014.pdf)  
[**UC Santa Barbara: White**](http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/common.data.set.2014.15.pdf)  
[**UCLA: Asian**](https://www.admission.ucla.edu/campusprofile.htm)  
[**UC San Diego: Asian**](http://studentresearch.ucsd.edu/_files/stats-data/enroll/ugethnic.pdf)  
[**UC Davis: Asian**](https://www.ucdavis.edu/sites/default/files/upload/files/uc-davis-student-profile.pdf)  
[**UC Berkeley: Asian**](http://opa.berkeley.edu/uc-berkeley-fall-enrollment-data)  
[**UC Irvine: Asian**](http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-ln-ucsb-latino-20150127-story.html)

UC Merced publicly prides itself on having a diverse student body and claims it “proudly serves the most ethnically and culturally diverse student body among all University of California campuses,” its website [**states**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/diversity).

UC Merced’s student ethnic demographics [**show**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) Hispanics make up the lion’s share of the student body at 3,022 students – or 48.5 percent.

Asians and Pacific Islanders come in second at 1,485 students, or 23.8 percent (Middle Eastern students are included in the Asian category if they are U.S. residents). White students place third at 795 students, or 12.7 percent.

📷Next up? “Nonresident aliens,” defined as students who are not U.S. citizens — either undocumented students or international students. There are 333 such students enrolled, or 5.3 percent of the student population.

After that comes 299 African-American students, which makes up 4.8 percent of the student body. The rest are listed as either “two or more races” or Native American, and 1 percent “declined to state.”

About 99 percent of the student body is from California, with only 24 students [**listed**](http://www.ucmerced.edu/fast-facts) as coming from out of state or a foreign country. That would leave 309 as undocumented students – more than the African American student population.

“UC Merced welcomes students of all ethnicities and backgrounds, and we are proud of the support that we provide to the highly qualified, UC-eligible first-generation students from our region and elsewhere who often aren’t exposed to higher education opportunities early on,” campus spokesperson James Leonard said in an email to *The College Fix*.

He added “undocumented students represent all ethnicities and nationalities. We often don’t know how they identify, which makes it difficult to compare that category to others.”

[**RELATED: Tired of Racism Claims, UCLA Student Sets Record Straight**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/16312/)

UC Merced also has a “Hispanic-serving institution” designation, handed down by the U.S. Department of Education in 2010. That makes the university eligible for a host of funding and grants from the U.S. departments of Education, Agriculture, and Housing and Urban Development. Interestingly, UC Merced does not offer a major in ethnic studies or Chicano/Latino studies.

[**RELATED: Hispanic High School Grads Outpace White Peers in College Enrollment Rates**](http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/13488/)

In some ways, the student population at UC Merced mirrors California’s demographic trends. Gov. Jerry Brown’s office [**reported**](http://www.ebudget.ca.gov/2014-15/pdf/BudgetSummary/FullBudgetSummary.pdf) in 2014 that statewide Hispanic residents surpassed whites, coming in at 39 percent compared to 38.8 percent, respectively. Asian residents come in at 13 percent, followed by Black residents at 5.8 percent. Multi-race was 2.6 percent, then came Pacific Islander and American Indian at 1 percent apiece.

“As the Hispanic population in California continues to grow, the proportions of the other race groups will decline slightly, except for Asian, which through immigration should sustain its proportion of the population over the next five years,” the governor’s office stated.

When asked whether or not certain ethnic groups at UC Merced appear to be underrepresented, Leonard says “it really depends on the context” and that “our distribution of ethnicities is much more similar to that of the San Joaquin Valley than of California as a whole.”

According to the most recent stats available online, white students are not the most represented demographic at at least six other UC campuses as well, but none of the campuses have such a small percentage of Caucasian students as UC Merced except for UC Riverside, which has a white student population of 15.6 percent, according to its [**website**](https://www.ucr.edu/about/facts.html).

And seeing that there is a high request for a central Discord and also seeing 5 different UCM Discord servers made, I decided to try to unite them all by making one central Discord here.

Q: Why join this one? 

A: 1.) Verified members- Upon joining we request that you verify that you attend or have attended UC Merced. This is to filter out scammers, lurkers, trolls, doxxers, online stalkers and predators, and other malevolent human beings that don't attend UC Merced and have no say in UC Merced matters.

2.) Official, Central Discord- Like I said before, we've been using Bobcat Gaming as a makeshift general Discord. We will still be using it for gaming but this new one will be used for general campus life as well as gaming. Not to mention, I have seen 4 other small UCM servers that have no verification protection. Some moderators and I will attempt to make this one the main Discord. This will unite all the UCM Discords and verify everyone as students/alumni.

3.) Professionalism and user Friendly- Our moderation team and I have experience moderating big communities (most notably the Discord for Subtle Asian Traits which had over 10,000 active members at one point) as well as interactions and debates. We'll have more cool emotes and we're also planning to boost the server! We're also knowledgeable about campus life.

So come join the UC Merced Discord Server- a school server created by students, ran by students, and for students just like you!

I emailed the counselor that sent me my recommended classes asking about adjustments that I should make to my schedule to be prepared to transfer and she said to ask during the school year. At my highschool the counselors were a major headache and usually set us up to get fucked over so after getting that response I'm not sure where my expectations should be. Also, if you can give advice, does it look like I'm on track to be eligible to transfer? I tried piecing it together myself but I don't feel well versed enough in navigating college classes and credits to rely on myself. I know I'm behind a math class and I anticipate playing catch up at community next summer. 

TL;DR Are the counselors unreliable at ucm and can you give any advice on registration for a first year CSE major wanting to transfer.

I took pre-calculus honors in my junior year of High School and got an A in it for both semesters mainly because the teacher was really helpful and went out of his way to help anyone struggling which made me learn the material better compared to what my Calculus teacher is doing right now.

My advisor hasn't really helped me with this issue, so perhaps you guys can. When it comes to math classes, how bad is it to be behind one math class in the CSE major? According to the flowchart they gave out at the beginning of freshmen year it said I was supposed to start off with MATH 021 and be done with 022 by the end of freshmen year. However, I placed into MATH 005 my first semester, and I just passed 021. How bad is it to be behind one math class in the grand scheme of prereq's for upper-division classes? Should I quickly go about and find a community college and take Calc 2 over the summer? Or will this have no effect and I just continue to take classes?

So I'm currently a senior in high school, and I'm leaning towards Merced for college. Now, when I applied I applied to Applied Mathematical Sciences BS with an emphasis in Computer Science. But now I realized that I'd probably much rather major in just straight CS. Is there any way for me to do this online or by calling the registrar, or only after my first term at Merced? And, would it be difficult for me to change into CS? My stats are a 3.45 weighted UC gpa in high school and a 1520 on the sat, with decent ecs. 

Also, I also want to pursue a minor (or maybe even double major) in Environmental/Life Science or Sustainability, and I'm not sure when you can express your interest to do this, but I did find online you have to wait till after one term at UC Merced to do this. Does anyone know if it's possible to state your interest to have a minor (or even double major) beforehand?

Hi everyone!

I am a transfer student who is planning on transferring to UC Merced as a Mechanical Engineering Student, and I have questions that I was hoping you guys can answer. My goal is to get a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering, then to eventually get my masters degree.

Also, I have been looking at the Cal Poly SLO Reddit page, and since I am deciding on transferring to Cal Poly SLO or UC Merced, I wanted to hear UC Merced student's opinions. I do not know anyone from UC Merced or Cal Poly SLO, so I do not know who else to ask haha. Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

\--

 

1. If you are also a transfer student, how easy was it to transition as a transfer student? I'm currently coming from a California Community College.
2. For those who are Mechanical Engineering majors or Engineering majors in general, what are labs like? How hands-on are they? Also, do they help enforce the theory that was learned in class?  

   1. I heard UCs are more theoretical and CSUs like Cal Poly SLO are more hands-on, so I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this. I was looking at the Cal Poly SLO Reddit page and everyone was saying they felt the labs were hands on. But UC Merced is ABET accredited, so I feel like UC Merced should also have labs that are hands-on like Cal Poly SLO.
3. I understand that engineers must learn theoretical knowledge to be engineers, but people are saying UCs are more theoretical and CSUs are not as much. Any thoughts on this statement? 
4. How is the student life? How are the extracurricular clubs? Any clubs that stand out? Is it eventful on campus and outside campus? 
5. Are you able to balance engineering school work with extracurricular activities? (Hanging out with friends, personal engineering projects, clubs, jobs/internships). 
   1. Also, what engineering projects or research are you working on? What extracurricular activities do you do?
6. How easy is it to find internships or research positions? Do you feel like classroom projects/labs/homework is good enough for companies to hire you or do you feel that it is required to do extracurricular activities to stand out? i.e. personal projects or hobbies. 
7. Kind of like question 6, For seniors and juniors, how prepared do you feel for the real world after doing engineering major focused classes/labs?
8.  How impacted are the classes for engineering major focused classes? 
9.  How do you like the class size ratio? Is it easy to make relationships with professors?  How easy is it to go to professor office hours? Are there TAs? 
10.  What are your thoughts on the final engineering projects at UC Merced? have they helped with practical experience and expanded learning on theory? 
11.  How are the resources and facilities there? I heard because they are new, UC Merced has a lot of latest equipment.  
12.  Fabrication center for personal projects? I know UC Davis has one. How does it compare to UC Merced's? Training services too? 
13.  What is the study environment like? Do you feel that it is cut throat or do you feel a sense of everyone helping each other? 
14.  How about professional engineering organizations? How active are they? What kind of projects or activities do they do? 
15.  Do you feel that going to UC Merced is worth it in retrospect? What if you could choose between going to UC Davis or Cal Poly SLO?

I was wondering if there any graduate students, specially Political Science Ph.D here who can answer some questions.

I have been admitted into the Phd program for Political Science and I will be making a decision soon. Right now my decision stands between the Phd Program or a Masters of HR and Labor relations from a top school. 

I feel some doubts about accepting the Phd program and I have the following questions, if anyone can provide some insight. I know that part of learning and the experience Is what you make it of it and I am also taking that into account. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you feel professors help with the guidance and do you feel supported by your department or program? any insights on this from the PS graduate students?

&amp;#x200B;

How is the social life for graduate students, is there an active nightlife in Merced or is it emerging? What do you do that keeps you active or relax when you have free time to yourself?  (if there is free time).

&amp;#x200B;

Is the stipend enough to live by the day? Do you feel that you are In need to cut on spending, get another type of job or problems in finding affordable housing?

I got back to Merced this past weekend and have been feeling pretty down about being here. Being a 2nd year, I feel like I shouldn't be dreading going to back to semi-independence at college; especially when I've had the time to adjust to living in this kind of environment. But I've been getting dogged by all the negative memories here that I can't seem to shake. 

I had a pretty poor experience in the dorms during my first year and I struggled a lot socially when most people seemed to be excelling. I joined a club thinking I would make friends, but I somehow managed to make that opportunity have the opposite effect. I'm moving into this new year with less friends than before, and I'm quite sad because of it. Add up all the other awkward and embarrassing moments I've had here and it just bums me out.

And the on the professional end...I want to put my head in the sand. I'm starting to have those post-grad talks with my parents and I feel wholly unprepared to enter the job market. While I do at least have a summer internship under my belt, I fear that I'm not making enough strides to prepare myself for a career.

That's not to say that I don't claim responsibility for how my experience is Merced is going. I am working on improving myself as a person every day but I make a lot of mistakes. I keep to myself when I should be more outgoing, I am supremely lazy when I could be out doing something in the community, etc., etc. Being almost halfway through my time here at UCM, I feel like a missed a lot of experiences and wasted time I won't get back. 

But I'd like to think I'm not sitting here and feeling sorry for myself. I am going to start a new job on campus soon and I'll be looking for new clubs to join this semester. It's not anything major, but I feel like it's a positive start. Better than doing nothing.

**TLDR:**How have you guys made steps to improve your experiences at the UC? Any advice on getting over the sophomore slump? And if anything, can any of you empathize? I know I'm not alone but sometimes it helps to hear about similar experiences.

The last major talent I can think to see is my typing skills and how the English language is really easy for me.  I type an easy average of 80wpm and can type a simple 5 page essay in around 30-45 minutes once I'm in the groove of things.

So far, my computer science classes have been so fucking easy and it scares me that these incredibly easy midterms are being used as actual midterms. These classes are a fucking joke compared to the other UC’s. I have friends in Irvine and Berkeley CS who have actually switched majors because of how notoriously hard their classes were. I feel like we’re being set up for failure because we aren’t being challenged enough and I’ve met some of the most incompetent engineers that I have ever met at this school. I know for a fact that we skipped some concepts in CSE 30 that are very important in the computer science world and it bothers me because those type of concepts are needed in the workforce. My main question is, does merced build competent engineers ready for the workforce, or are we all screwed?

Hello UC Merced, 

I have created a new subreddit [r/UofCalifornia](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofCalifornia) for all UC students in all campuses. Often times, people would like to talk to members of all others UC's and discuss about certain topics. There was no way in easily doing so, which influenced me to make this subreddit. I spent quite some time creating this subreddit (my first time) and I'm almost done setting up everything. I politely ask that you up-vote this thread so many students will be able to hear about [r/UofCalifornia](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofCalifornia) and become a part of this group.

I just had a couple questions.

1. I aim to go to med school and yes i know its long and tough and most people do not make it, but does going to UC Merced put in a better position to go to med school considering it is a UC?
2. I want to major in either Molecular Biology or Bioinformatics, so how is the biology department at UCM? 
3. How are the research and internship opportunities? Correct me if I am wrong but being a small school, I would think it would be easier to gain research experience with professors. Also I know there really isn't much going on in Merced itself, but are there internship opportunities if you go out a little bit?
4. Since I am leaning to pre-med how is the pre-med culture at UCM? Is it well established with many clubs or is it just kinda starting up?
5. Overall I just kinda want some opinions of the school from those already attending it.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully you can answer some of my questions :) Have a nice day!",1.0,0.0,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,609.0,public,self,Questions about UCM,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/8t7xdn/questions_about_ucm/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,richtext,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have been accepted to UCM for Computer Science and Engineering! I have a few questions to help me decide whether or not Merced is for me. For reference, I visited the campus last spring, and was able to visit a few classes, and i have been admitted to Cal Poly Pomona and CSU Fullerton for Civil Engineering.

1) I have been doing career research and I have been thinking whether or not I might enjoy something like mechanical engineering. How might I be able to figure out whether I like mechanical engineering over computer science? I'm wondering: Is Merced easy to transfer between engineering majors? I don't want to get stuck doing Comp Sci when I might hate it. For reference, I have mechanical engineering experience (Lead mechanical for robotics at my school's robotics team for two years, and did a lot of the machining for the robot). I have minimal experience with CAD, but I was able to pick up the ropes fairly quickly. On the other hand, I know comp sci is a more lucrative career-wise. I have an internship I just picked up that might have me do some web and app development, but I have had no prior experience coding. 

2) How is the social scene at Merced? How easy is it to make friends at Merced? The other schools I have been accepted to(CSUF, CPP) are to be known as socially dead. I don't know if I can deal with that. In spite of the engineering student stereotype, I know for sure I need to have a social life. 

3) How is the engineering school at Merced, and how has it helped you career-wise(getting internships, research opps)? I know how competitive the job market is nowadays, but Merced seems like a great place to stand out in. I hear about the many research* opportunities, but I'm curious about the recruiting. Are there good career fairs? Are there good industry connections? 

4) Why Merced over other schools? I'm aware of the financial benefits of Merced- the surrounding area is dirt cheap to live in. I'm getting a good deal on tuition as is, so at this point it boils down on what Merced offers over another school.

I actually wouldn't mind living in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a good way to focus on studies, but I'm a bit concerned about what you can actually do around Merced.

Heroes of the Dorm is an annual Heroes of the Storm tournament involving collegiate teams from all across the country. Teams of five compete against other schools for all kinds of prizes. 

I guess I should admit that I don't have any experience with competitive gaming whatsoever, but I believe it could be a fun experience if anyone wants to get together and make a team. I'm not too worried about actually winning the whole thing and would rather focus on having fun. 

I not exactly sure if this is the right place to ask about this or if anyone here is even familiar with the game but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. I'd rather meet and form a team before registering because apparently you need to pay Blizzard $20 dollars to register. I'm a cheap mofo so I'd rather not spend the money registering if a team can't be formed.

Anyway post a comment or send me a message if you're interested. If we can get a group of 5-6 people together then we can discuss the nitty-gritty later. Registration closes on 2/5/18.

I'm trying to rent a unit to a Section 8 tenant that I think really deserves a chance. I even reduced rent a little so she would qualify. But the Housing Authority needs a stamped deed showing that I own the property. Problem is I don't live close by, and I can only pick it up during business hours.

So that's where one of you might come in. If you can pick up the document from the City of Merced and drop it off at the Housing Authority (I'll give you addresses and document # so you get the right ones), that would be a great help. I can Paypal you for your troubles.

I'll PM anyone interested for the details. Thanks!

WRI 10 - College Reading and Composition
MATH 11 - Calculus 1
CHEM 2 - General Chemistry 1
BIO 1 - Contemporary Biology
USTU - Introduction to Undergraduate Studies

Now to provide a little background, I've already taken and passed both AP Biology and AP Calculus AB (4 on the AP Bio test) and I passed both the math and chemistry placement tests with almost perfect scores. So I was wondering if any of the courses I'm taking are similar or more difficult than the AP classes I've taken, or if they'll just feel like repeats of the same classes. I was warned that Bio 1 would be one of the harder classes because it is more heavily reliant upon a textbook and that Calculus 1 was usually taken at a more brisk pace, which sounded intimidating because I was definitely not the best at Calculus last year. 

Another issue is the USTU course, I was told that because I have so many units already, I should just drop anything that isn't essential. If anyone could provide any insight to this course it would be greatly appreciated. Either this one or the Success in NatSci Preparatory class, which I was considering swapping out for the USTU course. I would just like to know what a comfortable amount of units for an adjusting freshman would be because I seem to be overdoing it a little.

I had planned on being in a triple originally, I had gathered and vetted my two choices for roommates and determined that I had selected some pretty cool people, and luckily we were all down for getting a triple in half dome. From what we had heard it was the best possible choice, not too crowded, relatively spacious, and at a reasonable cost. However, when we checked the housing portal it said that we were in a quad room with one other person, and right in front of the bathroom nonetheless. I'm asking for any and all insight into what living in a quad room is like. 
-Is it noticeably bigger than a triple and is it enough of an expansion to accommodate another person? 
-If the housing department selects a roommate for you, do they base it off of your preferences or is it random? What are the chances of getting a ""roommate from hell"" if it's a luck of the draw kind of thing? 
-Also, strange afterthought here, but is it bad to live across the hall from the bathroom? On one hand it seems better to have first dibs on the showers in the morning alongside instantaneous access to the bathroom. However, I know school restrooms have a very high tendency to smell like urine and be extremely loud with those ""industrial level"" toilets.

I'm coming into Merced for the incoming year and I have a few questions that I've been having trouble finding.
So first off, I attended the UCM Insider program, which is just spending a night over on campus, in Half Dome. I told the dormies there that I was interested in housing up in Mariposa or Tuolomne, and they responded saying that I shouldn't because there's so much highschool drama there since everyone knows eachother and people talk. Everyone knows who everyone had sex with, the walls are thin so theres always fuss over music, and having to clean your own bathroom gets disgusting. They also mentioned that that's where the ghettoest people house and they call it the projects because people act and live there like its the projects. This drastically changed my mind but I still really want to know what it's like there. 
I've come from a really ghetto high school full of shittons of drama and I'm done with that life. Yet I still want to get to know and meet people, I just don't know which dorm I have more of an advantage in (I'm good at meeting people but which has more advantage). I was thinking of dorming in Sierra Terraces then one of the other dorming places but idk anymore. Tell me brutally honest what it's actually like living in the dorms, with all the tour guide talk set aside.
1) How much high school drama is there in the Sierra Terraces (as in petty fighting, rumours, gossip, etc)
2) How ghetto are the people who live there
3) Is there a certain kind of mindset that most dormies have here
4) How thin are the walls
5) how annoying is it to clean other people's sh*t in the toilet
6) Why should i dorm in Sierra Terraces as opposed to other dorms
7) should I dorm there
I'm going to major in Computer Science and Engineering if that's any help. Thanks stranger ┬┴┬┴┤ ͜ʖ ͡°) ├┬┴┬┴

TL;DR: Are the Sierra Terraces bad place to dorm? Why? ^Questions up there ",,0.0,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,,,self,Housing Culture Questions,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/6675q4/housing_culture_questions/,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1470552819.0,,,

I'm a student from Singapore who will be studying at UC Merced for the upcoming Fall semester. I've been browsing around this sub-reddit for a bit, and would greatly appreciate any answers or discussion regarding some questions which I have!

1. I've read a little that the food provided in the meal plans is pretty bad and overpriced. Is this the current situation? Also, is there usually a wide selection of dishes available? I have some minor food allergies and so it'd be assuring to know that there are always dishes which I can eat for each meal.

2. Are there affordable food options close to the campus? Say within 20 minutes of public transport (or better still within 20 minutes of walking)?

3. Are the common off-campus accommodations conveniently accessible by walking/public transport?

4. I've read that the air quality is quite bad. Does this refer to the actual smell or does it smell 'normal' (but still slightly harmful)? Is it necessary to take any precautions with regard to this?

5. Are the areas near to the campus generally quite safe? In Singapore it is usually quite safe to go out alone at night in most areas. Not that I'm intending to explore the areas past midnight, but how about from 8 to 10pm for example?

6. Is there an orchestra in UC Merced for non-music majors (i.e. amateur musicians)?

7. What usually happens during the 'mandatory' orientation program? Would it be a great loss if I'm unable to attend most of it or if I can only reach UC Merced after the orientation program?

8. Lastly, is there anything in particular I should take note of as a foreign visiting student coming to UC Merced?

Thanks and have a good week ahead :)",,0.0,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,,,self,Spending a semester at UC Merced - Some questions!,,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/64w39d/spending_a_semester_at_uc_merced_some_questions/,,,,,,,,,,{},,{},,,,,,,,0.0,,,0.0,,,,,,,1491901082.0,,,

I'm currently a student at SJSU and, at the time, was being told by the housing office here at SJSU that I wasn't going to get housing. I legitimately thought, fuck it, I'll take my chance with Merced. I'm a Fresno native, so why not? Long story short, I got housing at SJSU at the last minute. I'm in San Jose now, but got an e-mail last week letting me know I got into UCM with a better financial aid package than I have at SJSU--no loans and no out of pocket costs like I have here. (SJSU gave me a good amount of grants and stuff, but I had to take out $5000 in loans for the fall semester, as well as pay $1700 from my own bank account.) It makes my insides cry thinking that I could have prevented all that if I had just applied to UCM originally instead of being an asshole and thinking that UCM was beneath me because it's just ""UC Fresno State."" 

Yeah, okay, let's get to the point: I'm legitimately contemplating transferring over to UCM. From Google, it looks like everything is better there for some reason. Better study abroad programs (I really want to study abroad and SJSU just has creepy exchange programs), new Global Arts and Studies major that looks legit, and that whole high-speed rail thing is supposed to be coming. But it's close to home and I wanted to get away from that Central Valley lifestyle of fast food, cows, bad air, and summer heat.

I'm a senior in high school who's applying to a considerable amount of UCs and I'm considering adding UC Merced as a safety school to that list. 

I was doing some research on your school, and I noticed that the school, in 2015, decided to approve the 2020 project-- which aimed to double the campus's size in 5 years as well as increase the student population to 10,000. It's been about a year since the project was approved and I had a few questions:

* Have there been signs that a massive construction project is underway? 

* Is the campus really constantly expanding? 

* Does the school ever feel too small at times, population-wise?

* How long would it take a person to walk across the campus at a normal pace?

* Do you think that the 2020 project will actually be completed by 2020?

If the demand is high, the website will automatically pair bulk pricing options with the seller or promoter. For example, if there are 6 buyers to Coachella music festival, then the website will seek a seller willing to sell all 6 tickets at a much more discounted price (or 3 sellers of multiples of two tickets).

I have until May 22 to decide, and I just got the email last night. I won't be able to visit Merced since I just went 2 weeks ago up north (from SD) to visit Pomona, Sonoma, Chico, and Humboldt and can't afford to go again. I originally got declined by all the UC's, so I was pleasantly surprised that I got that email. 

My major is Computer Science and I plan on eventually going to grad school to research swarm algorithms and robotics. From what I've read, UC's are for research opportunities and CSU's are more vocation training than 

I've done some preliminary research on UC Merced and got the gist of it so far:

+pro

-con

* +Small town/Low Population Density
* +Good diversity of students, with many first generation students (like myself)
* +Easy to get into classes, smaller class sizes, and teachers focus on teaching just as much as their research
* +Low cost of living
* +It's a UC, meaning facilities, funding and quality of education are good
* -Commuter school (looking for active community, clubs and open minded people not controlled by their parents)
* -Car required?


Chico:

* + Culturally and historically rich, plus very diverse
* + Well established CS curriculum
* + Their environment is beautiful. Lots of trees, river flowing through the campus, and Bidwell park
* + Very bicycle friendly (I commute by bike)
* + Half the tuition of UC's
* -It's a CSU, thus many people will go there simply for the piece of paper to get a job

I was set on going to Chico because I was blown away by the campus and feel of the town, but this opportunity is too good to let go without consideration. 

I have a few concerns:

How's the bicycle infrastructure? Can I bike to and from a place off campus? Are there places available close to campus to rent?

I'm not going to get any financial support from my family, meaning that I'll have to take out student loans. My credit is very bad due to bad choices I've made out of desperation in my past, will I be able to survive with federal aid(grants, loans, etc) and a part time job alone or are private loans a necessity in my case? The tuition is my main concern. Chico has already awarded me with enough loans and grants to live there comfortably. Can this be done for me in Merced?

On the UCMerced site it states that admissions for transfer is a 2.4 GPA, and 2.8 for out of state students.

In my cover letter, I can definitely write a lot to justify the bad grades that I had received in the past 2 years. Definitely went through a lot of hardship that I can discuss, especially coming from a low income/high crime rate area in NY.

  I am currently a student at a California community college completing from IGETC and Biology BS pre-reqs, and UC Merced has been one of the schools that I'm interested in. With that in mind, I had a few questions.

  How is the Biology program here? Is it hyper-competitive here? How is the class availability? I would be hopefully be applying by the end of 2016, to enroll for the 2017 fall semester. I would be looking into the Biology with Ecology option at UC Merced.

  That being said, I am especially interested in plant based research or marine related(might be the wrong place for this?), as well as any ecological restoration related opportunities. I understand that Merced is the newest of the UC's so ideally research options would not be nearly as overcrowded with applicants as elsewhere in the UC system? More importantly, would I be at a disadvantage as a transfer student?
   Also, can you pick a minor as a transfer(once enrolled @ Merced I mean)? I haven't found anything on the UC Merced site that says no, but I wanted to hear from people who have been here.

  Something else I had on my mind was the overall atmosphere at the school. Is it heavily commuter or is it more closely knit? Merced seems like the isolated knit type of college I am interested in. Also, how is the dorming situation at UC Merced? I would more than likely be dorming if accepted, and I wanted to hear any experiences on that. 

Of course, if there is anything else I should know as a transfer, such as admission hikes, or anything else very important, please feel free to type as much as you can!",,,0.0,ucmerced,t5_2seck,,,self,Biology program as a transfer?

Hoping to come to NorCal for 4 or possibly more years, then come back and hopefully attend a southern UC for grad school (that is the case now, but that may change due to open-mindeness). For the UCs, looked at Berkeley, Davis, Santa Cruz, and Merced. Dropped Berkeley and Davis out of consideration since I am planning to do a career in Statistics, and they emphasize graduate and professional school, obviously. Both amazing and reputable schools, but it would suck to stay at the same school for whatever many years since I love experiencing new things all the time and just being a number. On the edge of getting ready to apply to UCM and UCSC.

But at UCM, they do not have a undergraduate Statistics major, but rather an Applied Mathematics major. They do have graduate studies for Applied Math though up to PhD. Plus, it is a small student body size compared to the other UCs. To add to that, from last year UCM only had around near to 400 graduate students, that is not a lot to be honest comparing other schools. It just does not seem like UCM focuses on graduate school compared to the other UCs.

So can anyone elaborate on this, preferably your experience on how much attention you got from professors, faculty, etc.?

I'm  an upcoming freshman at UC Merced this year and I'm planning to start a rowing club this fall. 

Funding will likely be an issue for the first year unless we find some generous alumni, as school policy on sport clubs requires the club to be self sufficient for the first year. After the probationary period ends, I'm hoping we can expect a lot of help from the university since rowing is a big sport in college. I'm hoping they'll help pay for a boathouse on Lake Yosemite, and new shells. 

This year, I want to purchase a used 4+ or 8+, probably from another university, and even enter a couple of smaller competitions as we get the program off the ground. It'd be nice to have a coach, but I'm not sure how hard it would be to find one in the area. I'm also not sure if the gym on campus has ergometers, so we might have to raise money for those too. 

We'd be competing in the WIRA circuit, which includes most of the UC's, most of the CSU's, University of Oregon, Washington State, and pretty much all the school in the west with rowing programs. 

I'm hoping I can find some passionate people and turn this into a robust and competitive crew program. It'd be nice if eventually we became a varsity sport but some sport club programs (UC Davis, UO) have been pretty successful, so I'm not too worried about it. Since this is going to be a new sport club, pretty much every leadership position is up for grabs, and even if you don't have any experience rowing, you can join! It's a chance to help start a tradition that will last long after you've graduated and it'll be really fun, I promise. It's also a chance to make lifelong friends, and get involved in something bigger than yourself. PM or just reply if you're interested; tell your friends, family, dog, etc. I look forward to rowing with you guys!

I realize that prestige isn't everything but seeing how UC Merced isn't widely well known or ""respected"", it is a small but current factor for me.

Also, how is the social life? Has it evolved from the many posts saying everyone just goes home for the weekends and that many places in the city aren't open past 10 pm, etc. 

AND! Are people still able to transfer over to UCLA/Berkeley/San Diego at less than an impossible chance of acceptance?

1. Do you like UC Merced? Is there anything future students should know?

3. How difficult is it to transfer from Merced to another UC? I'm thinking of maybe transfering to another UC (possibly Berkeley) if I get bored of Merced after a couple years.

4. How long does it take for the housing application to go through? When will I be able to pick my room?

UC Berkeley has been my dream school since middle school, and I just want to know if anyone else was in my situation. Having to make a decision in one month that will basically decide my whole future is terribly stressful and I'd appreciate any suggestion. Thanks! I applied as a bioengineering major if that affects anything.

**What this?**

For those of you not aware, this is the first year of UC Merced's Mobile AppChallege.  It's a competition where groups of students create a mobile application, then compete based on the merits of said application.

[MyStudi.es](http://mystudi.es) is an application used for finding people to study with.  The premise is simple.  In every class there's always one or two people who just understand the material, but you'd never fell comfortable giving your Facebook or cell # to them. Use MyStudies instead!   Anybody can create a study group, and anybody can search for public study groups.  Having trouble with balancing equations in Chem2?  Just search for anybody hosting a Chem2 study session and see who's hosing a session and where.  It's that simple.


**What do?**

I am asking for your help.  Please vote for our application - [MyStudi.es](http://mystudi.es) by clicking **[here](http://mobileappchallenge.ucmerced.edu/) **.

There are, of course, other worthy applications in the [Mobile App Challenge](http://mobileappchallenge.ucmerced.edu/), so feel free to check those applications out, too.

If you were a 90's kids or just wanted to be one, there is probably something in his collection for you. There will have tables set up in the back of Red Sky Comics for the hours of operation on Saturday, April 14th from 1 pm til 6 pm. Both cash and credit accepted (via Square - separate from the store)!

Major pieces include over 100 different Transformers figures, both in and out of the box, dozens of nerdy t-shirts, extensive Star Wars action figure and RPG collection, MONSTERPOCALYPSE figures and buildings, Warhammer 40K bits and models, and much much more!

Do not miss out on your chance to reap the benefits of the nerdiest Spring cleaning ever!

Show up at 5, eat/drink some great food/drinks, have some fun playing games for a bit.

What do you guys/gals think? Plan on coming? **Can you bring some fun games?**

I'll give this a day or two, then send everyone that hasn't responded and recently expressed interest in a meetup a heads-up PM since we always end up having a couple people that found out about a meetup too late. I'll also print out something to avoid the awkward ""hey are you here for the reddit meetup?"".

For those of you on-campus (myself included), you can take the E1 bus if you don't want to rely on someone else for a ride. It leaves scholars lane at 4:08 and will get you to the Hollywood Theatres Mainplace stop at 4:56 (if it's running on time). Then just walk half a block and you're there!

**EDIT My ride flaked so I'm going to be about an hour late, at which point the sign I was going to bring will be useless. Hopefully you guys can take the initiative and find/organize yourself... there should be around 7 people**",,,,ucmerced,t5_2seck,,,self,Feb 25 meetup?,,,,http://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/pz09k/feb_25_meetup/,,,,,,,,,,{},,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1283058209.0,,,

Since I made a suggestion for a meetup in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/osohj/we_had_a_nice_moderately_successful_meet_up/), I wanted to start the discussion to plan the meetup for tomorrow, in case people were waiting for someone to do so. ~~I also want to mention that I might not make it.~~

So let's discuss what the Mercedditors want to do tomorrow. I mentioned Coffee Bandits game night (we'd also get [discounted drinks](http://www.reddit.com/r/ucmerced/comments/osohj/we_had_a_nice_moderately_successful_meet_up/c3k2hiv) if we mention the Reddit Meetup).

What else can we do? Just throw out ideas or interests if you can't think of anything activities. Be **BRAVE**.

**Edit:** Perhaps we should meet before night time?  If so, I could make it. Furthermore, those that use the bus don't have to worry about being stranded.

My name is David and I am a senior here. I am interested in starting a social club which would focus on the homebrewing of beer. I say social club because I doubt the school would be willing to lend any kind of support considering that we would be making alcohol.

The club would basically be focused on getting members started with the basic amount of equipment, supplies, and knowledge required to homebrew beer. I have a large amount of equipment which I could allow members to use and I have brewed several batches myself. Eventually it would be great to be able to have tastings where we sample each other's beer and give advice/criticism. The equipment for brewing only needs to be purchased once and the cost of brewing a single 5 gallon batch (about 50 12 oz bottles) is approximately $40.00. 

Brewing is a fun and interesting hobby which allows you to create a delicious product from basic ingredients. If you are interested please let me know by responding in this thread or email djohnston3@ucmerced.edu.

The UC doesn't pull from your financial aid until the payment deadline has passed which conveniently holds a $50 dollar late fee charge. The deferred payment plan charges you $40 dollars for the lovely convenience of saving $10 from a late fee. REALLY?!

What are your craziest Merced stories? I'm getting emails  about guys getting shot and stuff, so I assume that there is some interesting shit that goes on here.

Well I'll start- so some friends and I took Cattracks to a part of Merced that, according to the bus driver ""wasn't the best part"" at about 1am (near the Edward Jones). We finally found a jack-in-the-box and tried to walk through the drive through when this guy came up with a switchblade and said, ""I'm going to rob this car"" while laughing. He unlocked the car, got in, and the car drove away. Scared the shit out of me, though others in our group said they saw the driver laughing. I'm not sure if he was joking, drugged, or just insane, but I'm never going into the city again.

Not too crazy but it's my first week here. Definitely more shetchy than where I'm from.

-I understand that the School of Engineering has a new Formula SAE team, so props to them. If you're in Service learning, join them!

-There's always [Fresno SCCA](http://www.fresnoscca.com/) if you want to take your car out auto-crossing.

-If you're into drifting, there's an somewhat active central California scene. Check out [norcaldrift](http://www.norcaldrift.org) for the latest events in the area.

-If you're on facebook,search for ""beyond mention"", ""SSAutoPower"", ""FresnoSCCA"", and ""CenCalDriftproject"" to name a few that have events now and then.

-&amp; If you want to meet some fellow locals and chill on a Wednesday and Friday night after 8PM, Personal Message me your phone # and when our small group meets up, I text message everyone =)

On Wednesdays we meet at a random restaurant (usually Wendys on Olive) and on Friday we meet up around 8:30PM at Lowe's near Barnes and Noble. It's a cool way to meet and greet and maybe gain some connections if you need some random tool that you forgot to bring from home, or just want to shoot the breeze. =)
