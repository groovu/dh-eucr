Kelly Baird: "Now you're at Cal, and everyone is the smart Asian queer good-eyeliner nice kid and you're, like, nobody. Which is scary, because you thought that Cal wanted you because you were [that] and now everyone is better at shotgunning beers than you are, so what are you even doing here?"

Molecular and cell biology professor Michael B. Eisen, co-founder of the Public Library of Science (PLOS), has said in an interview that he intends to run for the U.S. Senate in 2018. He is interested in running because he believes there's a need for scientists to be represented in the Senate.
